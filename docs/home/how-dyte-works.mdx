# How Dyte works

Dyte is primarily based on the WebRTC protocol and the features and optimizations are built on top of it.

Although the protocol is supposed to be peer-to-peer, anyone who has tried
implementing it by themselves would know that the implementations get real messy, real fast.

To have a real working solution, servers with SFU, STUN, TURN, etc. capabilities are required to optimize user bandwidth and performance, route the data packets correctly and maintain a state of specific client-side configurations and preferences.

On top of managing this basic communication using media streams, Dyte offers additional features such as chat, polls, plugins, recording and streaming, and many others.

Dyte's mission is to make this technology available to developers for easy use.
And in line with this mission, we provide several implementations of Dyte's real-time communications services,
which enable you to integrate a meeting within a few lines of code without having any previous knowledge about media, streaming, or RTC but also allow you to go deeper if you so wish.

The features offered above the basic communication service are also under the developer's control. You can pick which features you want and to what level you want to customize them.
Pick from one of the [below available options](/#web-sdks) to suit your platform.

Meeting initialization, customizations, and most other features remain the same across all client SDKs.
